Forked from [https://github.com/baku89/ui-study](https://github.com/baku89/ui-study)

**[Demo](http://kevindoughty.github.io/ui-study/index.html)**

The purpose of this fork was to change knob dragging behavior. Instead of jumping to mouse click location, the knob value changes relative to dragging. I had to remove the arrows/zingers and feel that this was mostly a failure. This behavior would be more desirable if the knob had a larger diameter.

I like knob UI elements because one can get much higher precision than with a linear slider. With a small radius precision is poor, but if you drag perpendicular to the tanget (so the angle doesnâ€™t change) very far from the knob, the precision improves dramatically and is only limited by the screen size.

You can see the original verison with what I feel is less than desirable jump-to-click-location behavior but beautiful zingers and ulitmately a better experience [here](http://s.baku89.com/ui/).
